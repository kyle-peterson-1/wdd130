    <h2>Kyle Peterson</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kyle, a tech enthusiast with a passion for building, racing, and everything in between. I've had the privilege of calling multiple places home, from the sunny coasts of California to the rugged terrains of Arizona, and each location has left its mark on me.</P>
    <h3>Education and Asperations</h3>
    <p>I'm currently on a journey toward a degree in Applied Technology, with my sights set on a Master's in Computer Science. The world of technology has always fascinated me, and I'm determined to dive deeper into it.</p>
    <h3>Adventires on snow and wheels</h3>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can often find me on a snow-covered mountain, pursuing my love for snowboarding. It's a thrilling experience that keeps me grounded and in touch with the great outdoors. I'm also a proud owner of a 1981 Yamaha Virago XV920, which I'm restoring into a cafe racer.</p>
    <h3>Life's Greatest Adventures</h3>
    <p>About five months ago, I embarked on one of life's most rewarding journeys, marriage. I'm grateful to share this adventure with my partner, and we're excited about the path ahead.</p>
    <h3>Competitive Spirit</h3>
    <p>I have an insatiable competitive spirit that drives me to push my limits. I've taken on challenges like Spartan races and marathons, constantly seeking opportunities to test my mettle and improve myself.</p>
    <h3>Balancing Act</h3>
    <p>By day, I work as a BIM and VDC (Virtual Design and Construction) specialist, a role that I'm deeply passionate about. It allows me to blend my tech skills with creativity to shape the built environment. On the side, I've ventured into the world of reptile breeding, starting my own small business. It's a unique and exciting endeavor that keeps me engaged in diverse pursuits.
    In every aspect of my life, I'm driven by the desire to learn, grow, and excel. If you share any of my passions or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!</p>
